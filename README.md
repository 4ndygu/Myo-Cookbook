# Myo-Cookbook
This is a project made for LAHacks 2015. 

It uses the Thalmic Labs Myo Gesture recognition armband to seamlessly transition through
different steps of a digitalized cookbook. This allows for seamless, touchless interaction 
with a digital cookbook, optimizing the usage of the gesture-recognition armband because 
the armband will continually track the user's commands wherever they go---making the usage 
of the myo armband critical to the execution of this project.
